Homework for week one in this project i changed semantic html tags
in this homework assignment we worked on changing the non semantic html tags and turning them into semantic tags. such as anything as divs we would change them into the semantic tags such as sections which is more semantic . we also made the CSS section a lot more shorter putting all the matching styles under one section
